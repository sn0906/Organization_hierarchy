# Organization Hierarchy Application

![Organization Hierarchy](./src/assets/image.png)

A web application to visualize and manage organizational hierarchy structures.

## Getting Started

### Start Backend Server
node server.js

### Start Frontend Application
npm start 

## How It Works

The application allows users to:
1. View a complete organizational chart showing employee hierarchies
2. Add employees and their details
3. Manage reporting relationships between employees
4. Visualize the organizational structure in a tree-like format

The backend API handles data management while the frontend provides an interactive interface for users to manage the organizational structure.
